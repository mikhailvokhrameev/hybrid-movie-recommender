# ML Design Decisions and Evaluation

This document explains the reasoning behind each ML decision in the
recommendation pipeline. It covers what was chosen, what was considered,
and what the evaluation results show.

## System Architecture

This is a retrieval-augmented recommendation system, not standard RAG.
The distinction matters:

- **Standard RAG**: retrieve documents, stuff into LLM, LLM generates answer.
  The LLM IS the output and decides what's relevant.
- **This system**: retrieve candidates via ANN search, score with a
  deterministic algorithm, ask LLM to explain results. The algorithm
  decides what's relevant. The LLM serves two helper roles: intent
  parsing (input) and explanation generation (output).

This makes the recommendation logic explainable, testable, and tunable,
which pure RAG is not.

## Embedding Model

**Choice**: `paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2` (768 dimensions)

**Why**: The catalog is Russian-language. This model handles Russian text
well (trained on parallel multilingual corpora), produces 768-dim vectors
(standard), and runs on both GPU and CPU. No fine-tuning needed.

**Alternative considered**: Fine-tuned Russian BERT models. Rejected because
the catalog descriptions are general-purpose text, not domain-specific jargon.
The multilingual model captures semantic similarity well enough for movie
descriptions.

**Embedding text**: Each movie is embedded as
`"{serial_name}. {genres joined}. {description[:500]}"`.
This captures title, genre signal, and semantic content in one vector.

## LLM (Ollama)

**Choice**: `qwen2.5:7b` via standalone Ollama container

**Why**: Runs locally (no API costs), supports Russian, handles JSON mode
for structured output. The 7B size fits in 8GB VRAM and runs acceptably
on CPU (~10-20s per generation).

**Two roles**:
1. **Intent parsing**: extracts genres, mood, themes, negations, reference
   films from natural language queries. Uses JSON mode for structured output.
2. **Explanation generation**: writes Russian-language explanations of why
   each recommended movie matches the query (RAG pattern).

**Genre normalization**: The LLM often returns genre names in wrong form
(e.g., "комедия" instead of "Комедии"). An embedding-based normalizer
maps LLM output to exact catalog genre names by cosine similarity.
Configurable threshold via `GENRE_MATCH_THRESHOLD` env var (default 0.5).

**Fallback**: When Ollama is unavailable, `parse_intent` returns empty intent.
Semantic search via embeddings still works without parsed intent -- it just
loses metadata filtering. This is preferable to broken keyword parsing
that silently produces wrong results.

## Candidate Generation

**Choice**: pgvector HNSW index with cosine distance, top-100 candidates

**Why HNSW over IVFFlat**: At 18K items, memory overhead is negligible.
HNSW provides better recall without requiring a training step.

**Negation as hard filter**: User negations ("не хочу ужасы") are applied
as hard filters in candidate generation, not as scoring signals. A user
saying "not horror" means zero tolerance. Making it a scoring signal
(metadata=0.0) still allows horror movies through via high semantic similarity.
Hard filtering eliminates the leakage entirely.

## Hybrid Scoring

Three signals combined via weighted sum:

| Signal | Default Weight | What it measures |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Semantic | 0.4 | Cosine similarity between query and movie embeddings |
| Metadata | 0.3 | Genre overlap between LLM-extracted intent and movie genres |
| Session | 0.3 | Cosine similarity between session preference vector and movie |

**Cosine similarity mapping**: Raw cosine similarity ranges [-1, 1].
Mapped to [0, 1] via `(sim + 1) / 2` so negative similarity contributes 0,
not negative weight.

**Weight tuning**: Grid search across 6 weight configurations showed minimal
impact on LLM-judged relevance (3.55-3.60 out of 5.0). Semantic similarity
dominates regardless of weight allocation. This suggests the embedding quality
is the bottleneck, not the scoring formula.

**Configurable**: All weights are configurable via environment variables
(`SCORE_WEIGHT_SEMANTIC`, `SCORE_WEIGHT_METADATA`, `SCORE_WEIGHT_SESSION`).
Must sum to 1.0.

## MMR Diversification

**Choice**: Maximal Marginal Relevance (Carbonell & Goldstein, 1998)

**Why**: Without diversification, top-5 results for "хочу триллер" might
return 5 movies by the same director or from the same country. MMR ensures
variety by penalizing each subsequent pick for similarity to already-selected
results.

**Formula**: `MMR = lambda * relevance - (1 - lambda) * max_similarity_to_selected`

**lambda = 0.7** (relevance-biased): Higher values prioritize relevance over
diversity. 0.7 means 70% relevance, 30% diversity penalty.

**Why MMR over genre-based post-filtering**: Genre rules ("max 2 per genre")
only handle one dimension. MMR uses embedding similarity to catch all forms
of redundancy: same director, same sub-genre, same narrative structure.

## Session-Based Preference Learning

**Choice**: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of query embeddings

**Formula**: `new_vec = alpha * query_vec + (1 - alpha) * current_vec`,
then L2-normalized.

**alpha = 0.7** (configurable via `SESSION_ALPHA`): Recent queries contribute
70% of the signal. After 5 turns, the first query's weight decays to ~0.8%.

**Why EMA over simple averaging**: Simple averaging gives equal weight to all
turns. An early exploratory query permanently dilutes the signal from a later
specific query. EMA makes recent queries dominate.

**Explicit preferences**: Alongside the implicit vector, the session tracks
liked genres, disliked genres, themes, and reference films extracted from
parsed intent.

## Evaluation Framework

### Metrics

| Metric | What it measures | Implementation |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Precision@k | Fraction of top-k results matching relevant genres | `evaluation.precision_at_k()` |
| NDCG@k | Position-aware relevance (supports graded scores) | `evaluation.ndcg_at_k()` |
| Diversity | 1 - mean pairwise cosine similarity among results | `evaluation.diversity()` |
| Novelty | How non-obvious the recommendations are (genre rarity) | `evaluation.novelty()` |
| Coverage | Fraction of catalog appearing in any recommendation | `evaluation.coverage()` |
| LLM Relevance | Ollama rates each recommendation 1-5 for relevance | `evaluation.llm_relevance_score()` |
| Negation Violations | Count of results matching negated genres | `evaluate_scoring._score_query()` |

### LLM-as-Judge

When `--llm-judge` is enabled, the same Ollama model rates each recommended
movie's relevance to the query on a 1-5 scale. These graded scores feed into
NDCG for position-aware quality measurement.

**Known limitation (circularity)**: The same model that parses intent also
judges relevance. This creates evaluation bias. A production system would
use a stronger or different model for judging. For a portfolio project,
this is documented honestly as a limitation.

### Running Evaluation

```bash
# Genre-based evaluation (fast)
docker compose exec backend python manage.py evaluate_scoring

# With LLM-as-judge graded relevance (slow, ~2s per movie)
docker compose exec backend python manage.py evaluate_scoring --llm-judge

# Grid search over weight space (fast, genre-based)
docker compose exec backend python manage.py evaluate_scoring --sweep

# Grid search with LLM judge (6 configs, ~12 min on GPU)
docker compose exec backend python manage.py evaluate_scoring --sweep --llm-judge

# Custom weights
docker compose exec backend python manage.py evaluate_scoring --weights 0.6,0.2,0.2
```

### Evaluation Results

With default weights (0.4/0.3/0.3) and LLM-as-judge:

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| LLM Relevance | 3.59/5 | Honest score. System returns genre-correct movies but not always the best thematic matches. |
| NDCG@5 | 0.95 | Best-scored movies are ranked higher (strong position-aware quality). |
| Diversity | 0.39 | Results are reasonably spread across embedding space. |
| Novelty | 0.83 | Recommending non-obvious items, not just popular ones. |
| Negation Violations | 0 | Hard filter works perfectly. |

**Notable query-level results**:
- "советское кино" (Soviet cinema): LLM=5.0 (perfect, era-specific queries work well)
- "аниме для взрослых" (adult anime): LLM=1.8 (worst, age_rating not used in scoring)
- "хочу драму, но не мелодраму": LLM=2.4 (negation works but remaining dramas lack thematic fit)

**Weight sweep finding**: Minimal impact across configs (3.55-3.60). Semantic
similarity dominates. Future improvement should focus on embedding quality
(description augmentation, fine-tuning) rather than weight optimization.

## Production Extensions (not implemented)

Documented here for completeness. A production system would add:

- **Time-of-day context signals**: Hypothesis that evening users prefer longer
  films, weekend users prefer family content. Requires A/B testing to validate.
- **True collaborative filtering**: Requires user accounts, watch history, and
  rating data. Would use user-item matrix (ALS/BPR) blended with content-based scores.
- **Model evaluation pipeline**: Automated NDCG/MAP/MRR measurement with CI
  integration, regression detection on model changes.
- **A/B testing framework**: For comparing scoring weight configurations with
  real user engagement metrics (click-through, watch completion).
- **Cross-model evaluation**: Using a stronger LLM (14B+) or different model
  family for judging relevance, eliminating the circularity limitation.
